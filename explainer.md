So the first comment I got about this was critical. Saying my rng function was multiline and I had minified it. 
Acutally I hadn't. I'm just good at writing RNGs and I wrote it in one line without spaces. 
But here's how I felt when I got that critical comment:

i just feel, oh so i make a nice little project, and you just come and shit all over it.

it's not your right. this is my project and i say what's okay.

sorry if you don't like it but it's not your right to decide. it's mine. 

what's your problem? i'm just trying to do something nice...why not be encouraging. i'm not doing anything so bad, and this is a 5 line function, and you just come and shit on it. that's a bad person thing to do. you're nasty. just encourage people for doing things. don't be so jealous they're just doing something n you're not. just having some little fun n you wanna come shit on it. that's really awful n horrible. go away you horrible gremlin.

so yeah, you can see how i take criticism of my work sometimes. 
especially some tiny little work i just did for good purposes and put up quickly. 
i really feel it's horrible when people criticise that. and i swear they are being deliberately nasty. 
i just kept this text here to have a record of how that stuff makes me feel. 
i hope people who want to be nasty about things i do read this and think twice before saying something they know is gonna hurt me.

but some people will read this and then want to hurt me. that's what some people are like. they get pleasure out of hurting others. 
does that mean they're psychopaths or sociopaths or just bullys? probably one of them. anyone who needs to make themselves feel better
by trying to pretend others are worse, or by trying to hurt others is really pathetic. 

i feel there is a lot of that stuff in tech. and it's really sad because most of these people look like they were bullied in school. 
and then they just become like these horrible people, lacking in empathy or just trying to hurt others. no better than whoever hurt them.
they just end up taking out their issues on others without any justification. it's just horrible. 

i'm not really complaining about this, i'm just working out how i will respond to it. 
i think i ought to just call it out and hit back. 
that kind of reaction is frowned upon, but criticism is okayed, so there is this toxic dynamic of normalizing this kind of harmful to 
creative ideas bullying behaviour. i don't think i ought to need to make my self "tough" if i want to make contributions in public. 
i think i deserve to be treated kindly. but i understand people do not behave like that. so i probalby ought to just be, like, fangs out.
because i don't think i need to tolerate this kind of nastiness. im doing creative stuff. i want support. don't give me your bullshit repressed jealousy or you-got-bullied nastiness. 
just encourage. that's all i want. don't attack people when they're vulnerable and showing you some new idea, some new part of themselves, really. that just makes you a bad person. 

that's my advice to be would be bullies. and i guess, watch out. i'm coming for you. in retaliatory words if you try to hurt me when i'm just innocently releasing something good.

so yeah.

that is all
